#+TITLE:     Pallet Reference - Push over SSH
#+DESCRIPTION: Pallet reference documentation for pushing over SSH
#+KEYWORDS: pallet ssh push keys identity

Pallet executes scripts using push over SSH. Pallet provides several methods for
handling SSH identities.

* The =admin= User

To SSH to a node, pallet requires a username and an SSH key.  These are read
from =pallet.utils/*admin-user*=, which defaults to your username, and =id_rsa=
identity.  You can rebind this using =pallet.core/with-admin-user=.

* Other SSH Key Strategies
While convenient, having all your nodes authorise the same SSH key is not the
best security practice.  Pallet allows you to install a function to provide an
identity using you own strategy, with =pallet.core/with-middleware=. A
per node identity could be implemented using something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure  :session s1
  (require 'pallet.utils)
  (require 'pallet.execute)
  (require 'clj-ssh.ssh)

  (defn lookup-identity [node]
    ;; Implement this to
    ;; return [private-key public-key passphrase]
    )

  (defn node-based-identity
    [handler]
    (fn [request]
      (binding [pallet.execute/default-agent-atom (atom nil)]
        (apply clj-ssh.ssh/add-identity
         (pallet.execute/default-agent)
         (lookup-identity))
        (handler request))))
