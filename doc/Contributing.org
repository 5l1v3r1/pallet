* Tests
 Please make sure tests pass, and test cases are added to cover new code.

* Source Code Format
 Source code should follow the following rules:
 - No Tabs
 - 80 character maximum line length

* Changelog
The [[changelog][ChangeLog]] is maintained in the wiki, and is built using commit messages.

The changelog format is produced directly by git, just add the following to your
`.gitconfig` file:

    [pretty]
    changelog = format:- %w(76,0,2)%s%n%w(76,2,2)%b

To generate the raw input for the changelog, then run the following, replacing
`pallet-0.3.0` with a commit or tag that you want to start from:

    git log --pretty=changelog  pallet-0.3.0..
